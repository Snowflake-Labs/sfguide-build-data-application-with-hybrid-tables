# Build a data application with Hybrid Tables

## Overview

This quickstart will take you through building a data application that runs on Snowflake Hybrid Tables. [Hybrid Tables](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-hybrid?_fsi=siV2rnOG) is a Snowflake table type that has been designed for transactional and operational work together with analytical workloads. Hybrid Tables typically offers lower latency and higher throughput on row level and point reads and writes, making them a good choice for a backing source for an application that requires faster operations on individual rows and point lookup, especially when compared to standard Snowflake tables that are optimized for analytical operations.
